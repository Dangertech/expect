	I know, there is a big gap between this blog entry and the last
	and there's no real reason for that. I have a specific reason
	for this blog entry though: The launch of the first significant version
	of expect: <gl>v0.1-alpha</gl>, codename "Full Speed Ahead"!
	So what is it all about?
</p>
<h2 class="center hover">Human Interfacing</h2>
<p class="center">
	One thing I have given a lot of thought is how the player interacts
	with the game world. Most roguelikes take the obvious approach of
	binding certain keys to specific action, for example the key "H" is
	bound to the action "MOVE_LEFT". However, expect is a roguelike set
	in a cyberpunk future with definite technological themes (Oh I didn't tell
	you yet that I plan to unleash an autonomous pissed-off AI in the game
	world, did I?). A roguelike traditionally has some sort of <gl>log</gl>
	that tracks the actions of the player and possibly informs on game events
	that can't be delivered through the ASCII grid alone, like the actions
	of other characters or details about the surrounding area. Then it 
	occurred to me to expand the capabilities of such a log to accept player
	input, just like a <gl>terminal</gl>, or, how it is called in the code,
	a CLI (command-line-interface). By pressing the spacebar, the player can
	enter CLI mode and type commands into the text box on the bottom right
	(see screenshot below). The command is then submitted with the enter key.
	<br><br>

			which contains the log and a window where the user can type commands.">
	<br>
	As you can see, the CLI graphics are definitely a work-in-progress kind of deal,
	nicely demonstrated by the Version Entry that overlaps with the graphical border.
	But you can see basic styling that is based on a type that is assigned to
	every log entry. Right now, there are only three: MESSAGE, INPUT and DEBUG,
	but there will be more in the future. A type defines the visual representation
	of a log entry and later on, the user can toggle only specific types
	(to hide that "No command assigned to this key.", for example.)
</p>
<p class="center">
	In principle, commands work just like programs in any real shell: The first
	word of a command can be thought of as a real program that accepts additional
	arguments behind it (for example the "in" behind the command "zoom" is
	an argument). These commands can query responses ("write to standard output")
	that are shown upon command completion. From a technical perspective,
	a command is just a function; Let's take the "zoom" command as an example:
	If the function <code>process_input</code> detects the word "zoom" as the first
	word of a line of input, it calls the function 
	<code>std::vector<cli::LogEntry> cmd::zoom(std::vector<std::wstring> args, in::GfxManager& gfx)</code>.
	Every cmd:: function takes different classes/variables to interact with
	to ensure more safety but they all take a vector of wide strings as arguments
	and all return a vector of log entries as their "standard output". But that's
	not all: Instead of having standard keybinds like described above, a key
	binds to a specific command that can be changed by the player in the future:
	For example, the key "H" is mapped to the command "move left", which is
	executed as if it was typed in the CLI. This allows for extremely powerful
	customization, especially if the featureset of the CLI is expanded.
	<br>
	But I also realize that this is a very uncommon way to interact with
	a game for many potential players and it is extremely important that
	the CLI is easy to use and receives a proper introduction. 
	There is one game in particular that has a similar approach to human
	interfacing and handles it's introduction very well:
	<a target="_new" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/254320/Duskers/">Duskers</a>.
	I'll probably borrow some of its ideas later on.
</p>
<h2>The game world</h2>
<p>
	I was very undecisive about the specific setting and general design
	of the game for a long time, but I have some rough ideas and concepts by
	now. The game interface hints that the player himself is a 
	<gl>Truthseeker</gl> and utilizes the <gl>BECOME</gl> interface to 
	control a <gl>Vessel</gl>, the actual player character represented by the
	good ol' <code>@</code>. The Vessel
	has very recently moved to a cyberpunk city in the far future which architecture
	takes elements from the brutalist, contrast-rich designs from Blade Runner
	at the bottom and the neon, floaty bridgework of the game
	<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/746850/Cloudpunk/">Cloudpunk</a>
	at the top in the clouds. 
	<br><br>

	alt="A screenshot of the game Cloudpunk
	where the player stands in front of a dark and rainy city scenery lit by
	colorful neon lights">
	<br>
	The city therefore has a very vertical design that would be difficult to
	navigate in a traditional roguelike interface like it's implemented in
	the current version (the current version doesn't even have a third dimension
	yet). That's why I plan to make a <gl>semi-3D gameview</gl> where the
	player can see multiple "layers" of the world at once, a bit like in the
	game
	<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1189230/Door_in_the_Woods/">
		Door in the woods</a>, only that it's not just a meaningless effect.

	alt="A screenshot of the game Door in the woods displaying
	the semi-3D effect achieved on an ASCII grid by stacking multiple
	characters on top of one another.">
	<br>
	The game begins with the Vessel waking up in its newly-acquired flat
	where it is ambushed by a group of mindless humans after a short while.
	These first minutes with the ambush at the end serve as a tutorial for the
	game that can be skipped after the first time playing it. On subsequent
	runs, the player can find multiple options to avoid the attack or get rid
	of the humans in clever ways. Searching for answers, the vessel descends
	the apartment complex to find out that most humans seem to be overtaken by
	a <gl>hive-mind intelligence</gl>, a virus/AI. The Vessel was only not
	overtaken because it didn't have any cyberware (IOT-implants) in its body.
	This is also the excuse for why the Vessel has to start RPG-like at a
	rock-bottom of skill. Through acquiring cyberware, the Vessel gains many
	new abilities and improvements, roaming through the city and battling foes
	sent by the AI that's plotting against it. The AI should really act like a
	hivemind, that means all enemies are actually working together dynamically
	to control the city, and could even rebuild it over time for the convenience
	of the AI and the inconvenience of the player. But I'll ramble about that
	when I actually get there. The player then has multiple options to win the game:
	The player could find a way to defeat the AI or escape and leave the city in
	its own hands. I also definitely want NPCs that can be talked to and that
	have their own storylines and subplots that can be uncovered, to make the city
	really feel alive and establish an "Us vs Them" feeling in the player,
	similar to the absurdly good ending of Half-Life II that really sells
	the feeling of friendship and the alliance of the rebellion against
	the alien forces.
	<br>
	However, I really need to get a lot of work done before I get to the idea
	of writing a plot, so this is just and early draft and things might change.

<h2>Performance improvements</h2>
<p class="center">
	I also want to mention the massive performance improvements that have been
	made in the frama framework. Earlier, frama used a multidimensional vector
	that was constantly filled with objects containing the data of all possible
	characters of a frame. This wasted a large amount of resources for objects
	that aren't even visible most of the time. Now, only objects that are
	actually visible are stored in an unordered hashmap 
	(<code>std::unordered_map</code>). The great thing about these is that
	their access time to an element is always O(1). The key is a 64-bit unsigned
	integer, where the first 32 bits represent the X position of the value object
	and the last 32 bits represent the Y position. This means that retrieving
	a specific element is just as performant as adding one. This gets a big
	roadblock out of the way that I was worrying about: expect needs to be
	really good-looking so people actually recognize it as something different
	and that includes things like animations and shaders that can only be
	performant if the baseline framework can handle displaying a grid
	hundreds of times a second. Now that I don't have to worry about that,
	I can put in the next big thing:
</p>
<h2>Next up - Animations!</h2>
<p class="center">
	To touch a tiny bit on the future: <gl>Animations</gl> are the thing I would like
	to approach for the next release (v0.2-alpha), together with the <gl>semi-3D
	view</gl> I talked about earlier and hopefully some <gl>shader effects</gl>. By animations
	I mean in-grid animations, like characters changing color and shape without
	making a turn and also out-of-grid effects like particle effects or screenshakes
	or something. Why the former are a good idea can be nicely demonstrated
	with the game
	<a href="https://www.cavesofqud.com/">Caves Of Qud</a>. CoQ uses in-grid
	animations to represent if a creature or thing has a certain effect.
	For example, if something is sappy and sticky, it flickers yellow from
	time to time, or if a creature is sleeping, it's character is sometimes
	replaced with a "Z" for a short amount of time. This conveys lots of information
	without the player having to utilize the "look" command. Such effects can
	also be used to show bullets flying through the game or other things
	that move very quickly. In the same vein, I want to enable the Log Entries
	in the CLI to have more than one color. In Caves of Qud, items have different
	"color schemes" according to their material and to <gl>emphasize</gl> specific
	words in a wall of text like I am doing here. But give me some time, I
	have an interesting part of my life coming up.
