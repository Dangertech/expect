<p class="center">
	I am proud to announce that you are reading the <gl>very first entry
	for the EXPECT blogs</gl> through the newly 
	set up <gl>blog management system</gl>
	on <a href="http://dangers.works">dangers.works</a>. Just click on the
	<gl>EXPECT Blog</gl> dropdown menu there and be astonished by the 
	just works automation that my Raspberry Pi integrates. This blog
	should of course be about EXPECT and it's development but I'll just
	drop a few words to explain how this system works. 
</p>
<p class="center">
	The actual blog content is stored on the EXPECT github repo. This repo
	is stored and updated every few seconds on my Raspberry Pi, the very
	same on which <a href="http://dangers.works">dangers.works</a> is
	hosted (Yes, I am hosting my homepage on a Pi. Get over it). When someone
	visits the website, located just next to the github clone, a PHP script
	queries the github clone for all blogs found in 
	<gl class="special">$EXPECT_ROOT/garden/blogs</gl>
	and encloses their names in links. These links just point to a sort of
	shell page with a query string with the name of the blog entry appended.
	The shell page only contains a php oneliner that echoes the content of 
	the file associated with the blog name in the very same directory. And
	Halleluja, this way I can create new blog entries in the EXPECT repo
	and they are available for visitors of 
	<a href="http://dangers.works">dangers.works</a> (almost) instantly.
	Also, I can effortlessly style the blog entries with everything
	that HTML offers and also utilize the features of the website stylesheet.
</p>
<p class="center">
	And that's everything for this very first post! I'll upload the actual
	first entry soon, where I want to talk about the frama framework
	and the upcoming infra framework that builds on top of the former.
