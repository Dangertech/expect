	Now, the first central thing to decide on for a video game is, besides
	the concept, the <gl>user interface</gl>(UI). For most video game developers,
	this is an easy choice: If it's a 3D game, use the 3D capabilities of your
	game engine. If it's 2D, use 2D. But I don't have an engine. I have C++.
	Bummer. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Firstly, I need a general interface to the display systems of all
	my development targets - Linux and Windows. As this is a giant project and
	I don't want to do all this myself while the system is barely working, I
	settle on a library for this, <gl>SFML</gl>. Why SFML? It's popular, it's
	easy to use and it has some solid 2D features. I will see later on, especially
	when trying to create special effects, if this was such an awesome idea,
	but I'll have to stick to it for now. So now there's SFML, where I can
	smash random stuff, like text, on random positions in a window. That's a great
	start, but roguelikes are usually <gl>grid-based</gl>. Somehow, the program
	needs to emulate the behaviour of a terminal, displaying characters in a
	monospace font. And now, when I am in the interesting position on shaping
	my own character display system, why shouldn't I give it some treats that
	improve on the classical terminal? And that's why I made <gl>frama</gl>.
</p>
<h2 class="center hover">FRAMA</h2>
<p class="center">
	frama is a (comparatively) low-level framework for displaying <gl>frames</gl>
	that hold <gl>character-grids</gl>, operating on top of SFML. 
	You can instance a new frame, give it
	a SFML window it can display in, 
	give it a font and a size and then you can happily
	place characters within the grid. This is all pretty straightforward in one
	central class, <code>Frame</code>, which draws itself through the public
	function <code>Frame::draw()</code>, into the SFML window it was fed with
	in the constructor.
</p>
	<pre><code>
		namespace fr
		{
			struct ObjRep
			{
				std::wstring ch;
				sf::Color fill;
				sf::Color bg;
				uint32_t style;
				/* ... */
			};
			class Frame
			{
				public:
					/* Constructor -> feeds root window, font and inital sizes */
					/* Various interaction functions */
				private:
					sf::Font *font;
					std::vector<std::vector<GridObj>> grid;
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
<p class="center">
	And this is pretty much everything that this framework operates with! It is
	really lean and small because it only does a small but central job. I am
	careful to completely <gl>encapsulate</gl> frama into its own thing so 
	nothing gets mixed up and intertwined. There's the possibility to draw
	characters, other pieces of code can interact with it, that's it. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The neat thing here is now, that you aren't limited to ONE frame: You
	can instance as many as you want! And they all have independent fonts, sizes
	and background colors? A practical example where this will come in handy
	is with the sidebars/overlays in EXPECT: They could be scalable independently
	from the main game view. If the player finds the game viewport a bit too small,
	he can zoom it in and his eyes rest easy while the sidebar with information
	stays the same size. This is a central advantage of frama in comparison to
	a classical roguelike played in the terminal.

<h3 class="center hover">One Issue with frame boundaries</h3>
<p class="center">
	There's one problem I have with my design that I want to mention: A frame
	is defined by giving it an origin and an end, in window coordinates. While
	this might be useful in some cases, it is annoying in others: Although you
	can exactly define where a frame should go, it is of course not guaranteed 
	that the shown characters end where the set end is:
	<br>
	<img class="marginauto" src="https://i.imgur.com/fHtd72P.png" alt="Visible overlap between characters and frame border">
	<br>
	In this image (it is functional test 1 btw), the red background shows the
	borders of the actual frame, the area between origin (top left) and 
	end (bottom right). But the characters on the grid go beyond that because
	they have their respective size and the final character of course doesn't
	exactly stop on the end coordinate. I have implemented some features for
	developers to combat this, like the option if the characters should overlap
	or leave space free (one column/row less is shown) or functions to force the
	visual background (not the actual end coordinate) to the nearest character, etc.
	But in the end, it's still pretty annoying in some cases. But just making the
	developer set an origin point and then just their preferred grid size is
	even worse: It involves some annoying arithmetics every time the developer
	wants to know the actual boundaries of their frame. There isn't <i>the</i>
	optimal design - both have their tradeoffs.
	<br>
	<br>
</p>
<h2 class="center hover">In the future...</h2>
<p class="center">
	But displaying a grid is just the beginning, of course. As soon as I advance
	to actual game logic, it might get messy. That's why I plan on implementing
	another, intermediate framework, <gl>infra</gl> that operates on top
	of frama and SFML. It does <i>everything</i> that is related to showing the
	stuff that happens in game to the player, it sets up viewports, message
	boxes, the sidebars, visual effects, everything. And then, in turn, nothing
	of the actual game logic has to handle anything related to frama or SFML.
	Or at least that's my cherry-blossom inexperienced view of my future code;
	I'm yet unsure if this is really practical or makes any sense to use. In 
	general, I'm really unsure in which direction this game, from the gameplay,
	story and concept on one side, and from the code architecture on the other,
	will take off. Let's see what the future holds.
