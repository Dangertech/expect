# EXPECT (Working Title)
## An ambitious challenge with the long-term goal of creating a traditional roguelike

**Deadline (for initial release):** March 2025

## Exact conditions
In it's fullest, EXPECT was agreed to be a *free and open source,
minimalistic (in the scope of graphics, at least), procedurally generated,
open-world, sci-fi cyberpunk traditional roguelike written in C++*.
Also, the infrastructure targets are GNU/Linux as well as Microsoft
Windows, on the x86\_64 CPU infrastructure.

Not very specific, but I have my ideas.

At the moment, you see exactly nothing. I am in the preparation
stage, and it might take a while, given how much I want to do.
The things I currently work on are **frama.h**, a library to display
text grids with certain graphical effects, and the project documentation
(which I want to come naturally with the time).

(Look at [Inital\_Working\_Plan.md](garden/Initial\_Working\_Plan.md) for more info)

## Project Development

Interesting things are to be found in the `/garden/` subdirectory.
I plan to put my reference materials and blog there.

The blog is also hosted live on [dangers.works](https://dangers.works).
It is currently a bit cluttered but I plan to rework the website and make
it cleaner and more directed towards expect and my other projects.

## Installation

The game is currently not a game and just an aggregation of C++ code.
Installing it will result in immediate disappointment. But things change,
of course, I've got to be somewhere until March 2025. So stay tuned!

If you want to install this project anyway, do these generic things:

- Clone the repo and `cd` into it (Usual Stuff, you got this)
- `make`
