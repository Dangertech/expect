# EXPECT (Working Title)
## An ambitious challenge with the long-term goal of creating a traditional roguelike

**Deadline (for initial release):** March 2025

## Exact conditions
In it's fullest, EXPECT was agreed to be a *free and open source,
minimalistic (in the scope of graphics, at least), procedurally generated,
open-world, sci-fi cyberpunk traditional roguelike written in C++*.
Also, the infrastructure targets are GNU/Linux as well as Microsoft
Windows, on the x86\_64 CPU infrastructure.

Not very specific, but I have my ideas.

At the moment, you see exactly nothing. I am in the preparation
stage, and it might take a while, given how much I want to do.
The things I currently work on are **frama.h**, a library to display
text grids with certain graphical effects, and the project documentation
(which I want to come naturally with the time).
